    content: `If you are approved for a lease this is your estimated weekly lease payment. On this site, we use the terms "lease," "lease agreement," "rental-purchase agreement" and "agreement" the same. (We usually use the term "Lease.") Under your Lease, you can: (a) weekly, biweekly, or monthly payments or exercise an Early Purchase Option pursuant to your payment offer and some restrictions may apply in CA to acquire Ownership of the rented goods or (b) rent the goods for at least the initial term and then end the lease when you want by making all required payments and returning the goods. In NC, the final payment required to purchase the rented goods will be an amount greater than 10% of the Cash Price. If you are approved for a loan the weekly payment is only an estimate. Please review the actual terms in your loan agreement if you are approved. Your rates, terms and payment schedule are subject to approval pursuant to underwriting criteria and may vary by state. FlexShopper provides offers for Lease to Own Options, however, we do not make any loan or credit decisions and are not representative, brokers or agents for any Lenders.`,
